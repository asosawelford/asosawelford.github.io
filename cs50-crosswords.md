# Crossword puzzle generated by AI

This is an implementation of a [constraint satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem): given the structure of a crossword puzzle (i.e., which squares of the grid are meant to be filled in with a letter), and a list of words to use, the problem becomes one of choosing which words should go in each vertical or horizontal sequence of squares. It's a optimization problem. 

It was made as an activity for the Harvard's Course [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/). 

## How it works:

The program has several parts. 

* First, it check for each position, which words could fit in (the number of blocks equal to the number of words). This is called _Node Consistency_ and it generates a domain (subsist of words) for each position.

* After that, the _Arc Consistency_ is checked, using the [AC-3 Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm). In pairs, the words that do not have the same letter in the block where they intercepts are deleted from each domain.

* Then, a [Backtracking Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is implemented: within the remaining options,the IA choose one word and start to check other words to fit in the different spaces. If a point there is a error, the algorithm goes back and start over using different words.

* It uses two .txt files: one from the structure (it has *#* indicating closed blocks and *_* indicating open spaces) and other with the words (it's just a list).

* Command: 

```
$ python generate.py [structure.txt] [words.txt]
```

## Some examples

Look in my [repo](https://github.com/Marouxet/cs50/tree/03-crossword), to download the files and run the program. In "data" there are some examples.

We can try with the _structure2.txt_ and the _words2.txt_

```
Structure2. txt

List of words2.txt (fragment)

```
We run:

```
$  python generate.py  structure2.txt words3.txt
```

And we get:

```
█████████
███████B█
█YEAR██E█
█A██EACH█
█R██L██I█
█D██A██N█
██BOX██D█
█████████

```
After that, we could delete the word "behind" from the file words2.txt, and run it again:

```
█████████
███████E█
█YEAR██T█
█A██EACH█
█R██L██I█
█D██A██C█
██BOX██S█
█████████
```
To test other posibilities, I download a random list of words (2500) from  https://www.randomlists.com/. After that, I test the same puzzle with other words:

```
█████████
███████A█
█YEAR██B█
█A██EGGS█
█R██L██E█
█D██A██N█
██BOX██T█
█████████
```

It works!
