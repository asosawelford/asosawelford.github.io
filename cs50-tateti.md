# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This is an implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game using a [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm. It was made as an activity for the Harvard's Course [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/).

## Implementation

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and tictactoe.py. Look in my [repo](https://github.com/Marouxet/cs50/tree/00-tictactoe) to download the files. 

runner.py has been implemented by CS50'S staff. It contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.

tictactoe.py was made by my, and it contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves. r 


Download the files and run  

```
$ python runner.py
